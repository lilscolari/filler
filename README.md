This is the repository for the leibniz programming language created by TODO. We wanted to make a programming language that supported better math functionality and allowed users to easily integrate important mathematical tools within their code to improve readability and functionality. The Leibniz calculator was the first calculator that could perform all four basic arithmetic operations so what better name to choose for our language than that. Also, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was one of the creators of calculus, a mathematical field that introduces various symbols and concepts that we hope to include in our language.
